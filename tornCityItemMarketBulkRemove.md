## Torn City Item Market Bulk Remove
This script automatically clicks all "remove" links in your items listings.
It only works on [Your Items](https://www.torn.com/imarket.php#/p=your).
It inserts a button, but only if the site is **refreshed** (F5 or CTRL-R).
![Button added on top](a)

If you have items click "click all"

![Items listed](b)

All items are ready to remove, click "all YES"

![Items ready to be removed](c)

Finished removing, see the "ABUSE" error message, because of too fast clicking.

![Finished with Abuse error](d)
